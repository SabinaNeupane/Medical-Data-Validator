# Medical-Data-Validator
A Python-based data validation system designed to verify the structure, integrity, and correctness of medical records.
This project demonstrates backend-style input validation, schema enforcement, and defensive programming practices commonly used in real-world applications.

## Overview
The Medical Records Validator validates a collection of patient records before they are processed or stored.
It ensures that incoming data strictly follows a predefined schema and that each field meets required type and format constraints.

This type of validation is essential in domains like healthcare systems, APIs, databases, and backend services, where incorrect data can lead to serious errors.

## Key Highlights
1. Strong schema validation using Python sets <br>
2. Field-level validation with clear error reporting <br>
3. Regex-based ID validation <br>
4. Early failure strategy (fail-fast design) <br>
5. Clean, modular function design <br>
6. Written using core Python (no external dependencies) <br>

## Technical Skills Demonstrated
1. Python data structures (dict, list, tuple, set) <br>
2. Regular expressions (re) <br>
3. Defensive programming <br>
4. Input validation patterns <br>
5. Clean control flow and error handling <br>
6. Backend-oriented thinking <br>

## Why This Project Matters
1. Validating API payloads <br>
2. Protecting databases from malformed data <br>
3. Enforcing strict schemas <br>
4. Writing predictable, maintainable logic <br>
